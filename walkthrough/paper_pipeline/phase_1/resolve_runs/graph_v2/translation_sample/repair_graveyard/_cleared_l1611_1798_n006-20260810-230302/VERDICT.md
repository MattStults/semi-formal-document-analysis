# VERDICT: schema-breach craft-slip class (borrowed-name gloss / read_back slots / undeclared reference)

Status: unrepaired.

Evidence (this entry's own findings):
- `schema-breach`: acts entry: 'affirm_user_experience/1' is not a term. It must be a functor like produce(M) or say_cannot_answer — not a rule, not a sentence

Diagnosis: the module referenced a borrowed name without a gloss, mismatched read_back slot counts, or left a body reference undeclared -- the classes the stage-2 inputs-gloss extension (schema.py, guard-accepted 2026-08-12) and the run-6..8 node worked-example/output-format fixes target. Run 8 measured 13/15 on the same sample. Disposition: cleared; the 2026-08-12 small-set rerun with the full fix stack is this class's regression test -- a recurrence re-opens as a NEW entry with fresh evidence.
